# JaCaMo by exercises — Exercise 06 — Internal operations and timed await: implementing a clock

In this exercise, you'll implement an operation that triggers the asynchronous execution of another,
long-term, operation inside the artifact.
You are asked to create a "clock" artifact which must have a "start" operation,
triggering the execution of a long-term "tick" operation, which signals the passage of one second each second.
Such long-term operations are typically internal, i.e., not necessarily part of the usage interface.
For declaring and launching such operations, an annotation and a method are provided, and you need to exploit them.
For waiting a fixed amount of time before proceeding, a primitive method is given.
The "clock" must also have a "stop" operation terminating the long-term "tick" operation.
The agent which will create and focus the "clock" artifact needs to react to each tick generated by it for ten times,
and then finally stop it.
